# This is Hello World #

This is a variation on the classic "Hello, World!" program which uses a loop to print the message "Hello, World!" ten times. These examples were developed to supplement some training materials related to computer programming.

In general, each example is not necessarily either the most optimized or the most authentic, but is designed to give the reader an idea about the "flavor" of the programming language.
